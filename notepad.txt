what we got:
1.display notes on screen via altera
2.read music xml file and find notes to txt file
3.mechanical arm that writes numbers
4.recognize known songs by acrcloud


what we want:

*virtual piano for selfplayed music
	*pc send arduino notes one after the other (until hit max #notes or pressed finish button)
	*arduino sounds the notes as it recieves them (altera doesn't know)
		*sounds on speaker
		*sounds in mechanical xylophone
	*after the user finished playing (note limit or stop button required):the music is "remembered" on arduino AND on altera
		*altera displayes the full song recorded on display
		*arduino replayes the song recieved.
		*maybe: altera colors(indicates) the current note played (played by arduino) visually on screen
		*add a pause button in c# to stop the replay, and start a new song
			*(when new song starts delete all information recorded by altera and arduino)

*teach how to play
	*user gives an unknown mp3 file
	*using cloud we recognize the real name of the song
	*import the song from selection of xml files kept in folder
	*arduino writes using mechanical arm the number of the song
	*display the music notes
	*shows you in c# which note to press in piano
	*play via arduino the note pressed (one after the other)
	*can play the whole song by pressing the "play full song" button




communication protocol:
*selfplayed song is 160 notes maximum. no minimum.
*veraity of notes: 8 notes (do to do) no sharps.
*implement for altera-arduino communication: data lines for note, enable recieve line, delay between sent notes
*implement communication line between pc and arduino for: "finish writing", "end replay"
